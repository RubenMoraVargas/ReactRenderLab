## little explanation of code
This code is a simple Next.js 13 application, and this repository is a lab to show some rendering problems and solutions. 

This code uses all the code in the src folder, now, Next.js 13 uses the app directory, and all page.tsx has its own component directory with all components used; in this case, the project has only one page. The directory for the components, has three directories: 
- Atomic directory with atomic components.
- Layout directory with the Navbar component.
- Rendering directory with the principal components.

The rendering components have names of AWS services only for didactic purposes, and easy grouping. The components with the word "Optimize" are components that have a solution for the problem.

## Technologies used
